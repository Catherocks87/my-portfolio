# my-portfolio

When I started working on my web portfolio, I began with a clear plan in mind. I wanted to create a website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and showcased my skills and experiences in the best way possible. To achieve this, I followed a step-by-step process that included the following stages:


1. **Planning**: I started with outlining my goals and objectives, identifying my target audience, and creating a wireframe of the site's structure.
2. **Design**: I then moved on to designing the website, selecting the color scheme, typography, and other visual elements.
3. **Development**: Once I had the design in place, I started coding the website using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.
4. **Testing**: After the coding was completed, I tested the website thoroughly to make sure it worked correctly on different devices.
5. **Launch**: I launched the website on Github and shared it on my brightspace assignment.

There were some challenges that I faced during the development process. One of the biggest challenges was getting the layout to work properly on different screen sizes. I had to use bootstrap breakpoints to make sure the website was responsive and looked good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones; besides, was hard to figure out how to modified default colour scheme to my custom colour palette.
To overcome these challenges I did some research and looked for solutions online. For example, I used online tools to resize images and I searched info about Bootstrap colours on W3 Schools.
Creating my web portfolio was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about web design, coding, and optimization. I also learned the importance of user experience and how to create a website that is both visually appealing and easy to use.
Overall, I'm proud of what I have accomplished with my web portfolio, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a web developer
